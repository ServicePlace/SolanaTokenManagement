A beautiful, user-friendly interface for creating and managing Solana tokens (SPL tokens) with built-in security features and custom logic capabilities.

## Features

- 🔐 Secure password-protected access
- 💰 Create new SPL tokens
- 📊 Manage existing tokens
- 🔧 Custom token logic builder
- 🎨 Beautiful, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- 🦊 Phantom wallet integration

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Security

- Default password: `admin` (change this in production!)
- All sensitive operations require Phantom wallet connection
- No private keys or sensitive data are stored
- Client-side encryption for password handling

## Development Notes

### Token Creation
The token creation process uses the Solana web3.js and SPL token libraries. In production:

1. Add proper error handling
2. Implement token metadata using Metaplex
3. Add supply management features
4. Include token verification

### Custom Logic
The custom logic builder is currently a template. To make it fully functional:

1. Create a backend service to store and manage custom logic
2. Implement proper Solana program deployment
3. Add validation and testing features
4. Include common templates and examples

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add Metaplex integration for NFT support
- [ ] Implement token swapping functionality
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard
- [ ] Include token verification system
- [ ] Add multi-signature support
- [ ] Implement token vesting schedules
